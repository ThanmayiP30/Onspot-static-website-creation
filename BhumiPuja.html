    <h1 >Bhumi Puja ceremony</h1>
    <div>
    
    <p>The temple construction officially started again after a Bhumi-Puja (transl. ground breaking ceremony) on 5 August 2020. The three-day long Vedic ritual was held ahead of the groundbreaking ceremony, which revolved around the installation of a 40 kg (88 pounds) silver brick as the foundation stone by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. On the day before on 4 August, the Ramarchan Puja (transl. Puja of Shri Ram's feet) was performed, in order to invite all the major deities into the temple.</p>

    <p>On the occasion of the Bhoomi Pooja, soil and holy water were collected from several religious places across India, such as the Triveni Sangam of the rivers Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati at Prayagraj, as well as the Kaveri river in its orgin at Talakaveri in Karnataka and the Kamakhya Temple in Assam. Soil was also sent from various Hindu temples, Gurudwaras and Jain temples across the nation, as well as from the four pilgrimage locations of Char Dham, to bless the temple.

        On 5 August, Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered prayers at the Hanuman Garhi Temple in Ayodhya to seek blessings of Lord Hanuman for the day's events. The groundbreaking ceremony of Ram Mandir took place following this. The Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath, Chief of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), Mohan Bhagwat, Chief of the Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas and Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra, Nritya Gopal Das and PM Narendra Modi gave speeches.</p>
